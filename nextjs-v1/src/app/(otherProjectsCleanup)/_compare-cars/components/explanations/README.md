# NextjsV1 Explanation System

A clean and simplified explanation system for financial calculations in the NextjsV1 app. This system makes complex financial metrics accessible to users through contextual help and detailed explanations.

## Components

### üîç InfoTooltip

Displays contextual help for any financial metric via a hover/click tooltip.

```jsx
import { InfoTooltip } from "./explanations";

<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <span>Net Worth</span>
  <InfoTooltip field="totalNetWorth" />
</div>;
```

### üìä ResultsWithExplanations

A comprehensive financial analysis display with explanations, insights, and toggle between simple/detailed views.

```jsx
import { ResultsWithExplanations } from "./explanations";

<ResultsWithExplanations
  results={calculationResults}
  formatCurrency={formatCurrency}
  carName="Tesla Model Y"
  years={5}
  detailLevel="simple"
/>;
```

### üí° ComparisonInsights

Smart insights comparing different car options and investment alternatives.

```jsx
import { ComparisonInsights } from "./explanations";

<ComparisonInsights
  bestCar={bestResults}
  worstCar={worstResults}
  noCar={noCarValue}
  formatCurrency={formatCurrency}
  years={5}
/>;
```

## Extending the System

To add new explanations:

1. Add your field to `calculationExplanations.js`:

   ```js
   export const calculationExplanations = {
     // ... existing fields
     newField: {
       simple: "Short explanation",
       detailed: "Detailed explanation with context",
     },
   };
   ```

2. Use InfoTooltip with your new field:
   ```jsx
   <InfoTooltip field="newField" />
   ```

## Design Principles

- **Accessibility**: All explanations use plain language
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple explanations first, detailed on demand
- **Contextual**: Help appears where users need it
- **Non-intrusive**: Explanations don't clutter the UI
- **Consistent**: Same explanation patterns across all components
