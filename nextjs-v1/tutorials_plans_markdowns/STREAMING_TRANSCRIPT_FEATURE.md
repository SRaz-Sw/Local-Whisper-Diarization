# Real-Time Streaming Transcript Feature

## Overview

Added real-time streaming transcription that displays partial results as they're being generated, giving users immediate feedback during the transcription process.

## What Changed

### 1. Worker: Streaming Callback Implementation ✅

**File**: `src/app/web-transc/workers/whisperDiarization.worker.js`

Added `callback_function` parameter to the transcriber that sends partial results as they're generated:

```javascript
const transcriptPromise = transcriber(audio, {
  language,
  return_timestamps: "word",
  chunk_length_s: 30,
  callback_function: (chunk) => {
    // Send each chunk as it's generated
    transcriptionChunks.push(chunk);

    // Build cumulative transcript
    const partialTranscript = {
      text: transcriptionChunks.map((c) => c.text).join(""),
      chunks: transcriptionChunks.flatMap((c) => c.chunks || []),
    };

    self.postMessage({
      status: "transcribing",
      data: {
        chunk: chunk,
        partialTranscript: partialTranscript,
        isFirstChunk: isFirstChunk,
      },
    });
  },
});
```

### 2. Component: Streaming State Management ✅

**File**: `src/app/web-transc/components/WhisperDiarization.tsx`

Added new state variables:

- `partialResult` - Stores streaming transcript as it comes in
- `processingMessage` - Shows current processing stage

Added message handlers:

- `"update"` - Processing stage messages ("Transcribing audio...", "Identifying speakers...")
- `"transcribing"` - Partial transcript chunks for real-time display

### 3. UI: Live Transcript Display ✅

Added a streaming transcript card that shows:

- Partial transcript text as it's being generated
- "Transcribing... (partial)" header
- Animated red dot indicator showing it's live
- Message indicating speaker identification will be added when complete

```typescript
{partialResult && status === "running" && (
  <div className="w-full space-y-2">
    <Card>
      <CardContent className="p-4">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-3">
          <h3 className="text-sm font-medium">
            Transcribing... (partial)
          </h3>
          <div className="h-2 w-2 animate-pulse rounded-full bg-red-500" />
        </div>
        <div className="max-h-[300px] overflow-y-auto">
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            {partialResult.transcript.text}
          </p>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Types: Updated Message Interface ✅

**File**: `src/app/web-transc/types/index.ts`

Added new status types:

```typescript
export interface WorkerMessage {
  status:
    | "loading"
    | "initiate"
    | "progress"
    | "done"
    | "loaded"
    | "update" // NEW: Processing stage updates
    | "transcribing" // NEW: Streaming transcript chunks
    | "complete"
    | "error";
  // ... rest of interface
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Without Streaming)

1. User clicks "Run model"
2. Button shows "Running..."
3. **User waits with no feedback** (30s - 5 minutes)
4. Results suddenly appear when complete

### After (With Streaming)

1. User clicks "Run model"
2. Button shows "Running..."
3. **Status message**: "Starting transcription..."
4. **Status message**: "Transcribing audio..."
5. **Partial transcript appears** and grows in real-time
6. **Status message**: "Identifying speakers..."
7. **Final result** replaces partial transcript with speaker labels

## Visual Indicators

### Processing Messages

- ✅ Animated pulse effect on status text
- ✅ Clear stage-by-stage progress

### Streaming Transcript

- ✅ Card with "Transcribing... (partial)" header
- ✅ Red pulsing dot indicating live transcription
- ✅ Auto-scrolling as text grows
- ✅ Note about speaker identification pending

### Final Result

- ✅ Full transcript with speaker labels
- ✅ Color-coded speaker badges
- ✅ Interactive word-level timestamps
- ✅ Download button

## Technical Details

### Callback Mechanism

Transformers.js provides a `callback_function` parameter that's called for each chunk of transcription:

```javascript
transcriber(audio, {
  language: "en",
  return_timestamps: "word",
  callback_function: (chunk) => {
    // chunk: { text: "Hello world", chunks: [...words...] }
    // Called multiple times as transcription progresses
  },
});
```

### Chunk Accumulation

We accumulate all chunks to build a complete transcript:

```javascript
let transcriptionChunks = [];

callback_function: (chunk) => {
  transcriptionChunks.push(chunk);

  const partialTranscript = {
    text: transcriptionChunks.map((c) => c.text).join(""),
    chunks: transcriptionChunks.flatMap((c) => c.chunks || []),
  };

  // Send to main thread for display
  self.postMessage({
    status: "transcribing",
    data: { partialTranscript },
  });
};
```

### Parallel Processing

Transcription and speaker diarization run in parallel:

```javascript
const [transcript, segments] = await Promise.all([
  transcriptPromise,  // Streams chunks via callback
  segment(...)        // Runs in parallel
]);
```

This means:

- User sees transcript streaming in real-time
- Speaker identification happens in background
- Final result combines both when ready

## Benefits

### 1. Better User Experience

- ✅ Immediate feedback that processing is working
- ✅ See progress as it happens
- ✅ Less perceived wait time
- ✅ More engaging and interactive

### 2. Transparency

- ✅ Users see exactly what stage processing is at
- ✅ Can verify transcription accuracy early
- ✅ Clear indication of what's happening

### 3. Debug-ability

- ✅ Easy to see if transcription is working
- ✅ Can identify issues early
- ✅ Better console logging for debugging

## Performance Considerations

### Memory

- Accumulates chunks in worker memory (minimal impact)
- Clears partial result when complete

### UI Updates

- Batched updates through React state
- Efficient rendering with controlled re-renders
- Auto-scroll only when needed

### Network

- No additional network overhead
- All processing still local

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all browsers that support:

- ✅ Web Workers
- ✅ ES6 modules
- ✅ Transformers.js

Same compatibility as base feature.

## Example Console Output

```

🚀 Loading models with device: webgpu
✅ Models loaded and ready
🎤 Running transcription...

🔄 Update: Transcribing audio...
📝 Transcribing chunk...
📝 Transcribing chunk...
📝 Transcribing chunk...

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Short audio (< 1 minute)**
   - Should see 2-4 chunks
   - Fast streaming

2. **Long audio (> 3 minutes)**
   - Should see many chunks
   - Continuous streaming
   - Progressive text growth

3. **Different languages**
   - Streaming works in all languages
   - No language-specific issues

### Expected Behavior

**During Transcription**:

- Partial transcript card appears
- Text grows progressively
- Red dot pulses
- Processing message updates

**When Complete**:

- Partial result clears
- Final result appears with speaker labels
- Generation time displays

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. **Word-level highlighting**
   - Highlight words as they're transcribed
   - Show confidence scores

2. **Chunk-by-chunk speaker hints**
   - Show preliminary speaker labels
   - Update as diarization completes

3. **Progress bar**
   - Show % complete based on audio duration
   - Estimate time remaining

4. **Pause/Resume**
   - Allow pausing transcription
   - Resume from last chunk

5. **Edit while streaming**
   - Allow correcting text in real-time
   - Useful for live transcription

## Comparison with Original

### Original whisper-speaker-diarization

- ❌ No streaming
- ❌ Wait for complete result
- ❌ No progress indication during transcription

### Our Implementation

- ✅ Real-time streaming
- ✅ Partial results visible
- ✅ Processing stage messages
- ✅ Better UX

## Known Limitations

1. **Chunk size**: Chunks are generated by the model, we don't control size
2. **Timing**: Chunk arrival depends on audio content and processing speed
3. **Speaker labels**: Only available at the end (not per chunk)
4. **Word timestamps**: Shown in final result, not during streaming

## Conclusion

The streaming transcript feature significantly improves the user experience by providing real-time feedback during transcription. Users can see results as they're being generated, making the application feel more responsive and engaging.
